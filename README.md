- git: This is a version control system used for source code management.
- A text editor (e.g Visual Studio Code (recommended), Webstorm, Sublime Text, Atom etc.)
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SASS.

### Setup

- With git, clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.
- [Download the ZIP file from this location](https://github.com/mahdieh-dev/trilingo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or
  run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/) command to clone the files to your machine:

```
